 <li>Assume that, today, a wafer containing 120 processor dies costs 10000$. The yield decreases by 10% at each year while the wafer cost also decreases by 20% at each year. Then, what will be the cost of a single chip manufacturing after 4 years? Show your computations.</li>

 <li>A compiler designer wants to compare the performance of two different compilers he designed. The compilers are generating MIPS machine code from a C program. He compiles the same C program using the two compilers.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>According to the tables below, find which compiler is better and by how many times it is better than the other?</li>

</ol>
